Self-educated Software Developer with a demonstrated history of designing, developing, testing, maintaining, and delivering web applications, as well as good experience in Linux system administration, software design, team leadership, and DevOps. Skilled in dealing with Agile methodologies, which include adapting to changes in the workspace and rapid response to any new requirements. Worked on a drag-and-drop WordPress-like website builder, in addition to contributing to the development of an ERP system. I believe in self-education and focus on results rather than formality.
